# ChallengeTwo

I got the image for the french fries at the link <https://www.thebossykitchen.com/how-to-make-real-potato-french-fries-grandma-style/>

added image of my puppy for portfolio work spot.  will be replaced in time as portfolio is added to through this class and other work.

I really enjoyed this challenge.  I came into this bootcamp with no previous knowledge and now I built my own portfolio.  Is it perfect?  Hardly but I have to say that I am very proud of what I did this week.  I can't wait until I gain more and more to make it even better.

I think I can say that I need more time with the design/display of the page.  But I worked with what I know and lots and lots of Googling.
