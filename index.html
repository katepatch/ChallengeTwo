        <p id="paratwo">Did you click the link and get brought here?  I did that with coding!  It may not seem like much but I did it!  And I am pretty darn proud of myself.  This scrappy little portfolio (at least for now) is for me to showcase all I have learned and to prove I am a desirable candidate.  So let's take a dive into getting to know me!</p>
        <p id="parathree">Well as you can see I am Kate.  I am currently enrolled at the University of Utah's coding bootcamp.  It sure is tough but I am learning a lot.  I am a stay at home mom who decided to learn a new skill and get back in the work force after nearly 7 years.  I wanted to challenge myself and step outside my comfort zone and went with coding.  I have never done anything like this before and figured this was a worthwhile skill to have.</p>
        <p id="parafour">I hope you stick along for the journey I am embarking.  This portfolio is going to go through a lot of changes from now until the end of the program.  I am excited for this opportunity and am determined to see it throug.</p>
